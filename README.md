# Starting up a chat
 1. You will be prompted to input a name and a channel
 2. The name field is not required and a random ID will be assigned to you if it is not filled out
 3. The channel input is also not required. 
   - A channel name && a username can be ANYTHING, a name or a number (all special characters are welcomed). 
   - Creating a new private channel or joining depends on what you name it. 
       - It is recommended to use numbers and letters. If a channel is already in use, you will join it. If not, a new one will be created.
       - If the channel input is ommitted, you will automatically join the 'main' channel.
 4. You're in! Invite friends with your channel name! 
 5. To leave type: "Leave chat" and you will be prompted with a conformation.
